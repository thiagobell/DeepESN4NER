# DeepESN4NER

An implementation of Echo State Networks in pytorch for the NER problem:

* esn_toolkit: here you find a generic implementation of ESNs in PyTorch
* ner_src: contains the experiments using ESNs for NER

This work is related to my [master thesis](./thesis.pdf) which applies this ESNs and NER 
to the domain of financial documents.
